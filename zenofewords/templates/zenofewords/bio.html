  <h2>
    The early days
  </h2>
  <p>
    Since I was a small fry I knew exactly what I wanted to do when I grow up. As someone who excelled at natural and human
    sciences, absolutely dominated every sport I ever picked up and had written my first program when I was only 5, on a bamboo tapestry...
  </p>
  <p>
    Yeah, no. I pretty much sucked at everything. I was the goofy kid who liked to play and had a tough time paying attention in
    class. STEM only piqued my interest after I finished high school. It was mostly trials and tribulations since then, but I eventually
    emerged as a software developer.
