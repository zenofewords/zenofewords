    Considering I had no experience in e-commerce this project was a great learning opportunity as well as a challenge.
    I was responsible for the frontend and backend while also figuring out payment gateway integration.

    My first goal was to build a webshop from scratch because I "had to" know how it all works under the hood. The next
    objective was to make it fast. This is how I found out about WebP, the picture tag and source sets. It used to score
    in the mid 90s, but dropped slightly after the recent update which made Lighthouse audits more strict. But that's
    just new room for improvement!

    Additionally, the client requested basic user, newsletter, and inventory management, promo codes, product reviews,
    multi-currency, dual language support, and more. I'll admit it was a bumpy ride as the deadline approached, but
    it all came together in the end and the shop has been operating happily ever since.
